      <h1> Webcam Filter </h1>

      <p> The webcam filter is supposed to be a two in one filter for your webcam. By moving the mouse left to right, you can control the size of the pixels on the video. If you click the mouse, you can change the color of the video. I was inspired to create this because Snapchat and Instagram are around us everyday. Everyone is always editing colors and applying filters to their selfies, pictures or videos. My goal was to make this filter unique and different from other filters I have seen on social media.
